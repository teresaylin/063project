  <h1>PaperCast</h1>
  <h2>Created by: Teresa Lin, Erica Yuen</h2>
  <h3>Our idea</h3>
  <p>PaperCast is a tool that turns any paper into a podcast and helps you learn even while you're sleeping. Whether you've just pulled an all-nighter and are on your second one, or you've got the post-lunch lull, PaperCast will know when you're falling asleep and will read your paper back to you!</p>
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>A heart rate sensor clipped onto the user's ear sends continuous heart rate data to an Arduino Micro, which then sends the data to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi runs a program to continuously process the data to determine the user's average awake heart rate. If the user falls asleep, his/her heart rate will drop by at least 10 bpm. The program will detect this change and trigger a camera that is attached to the Raspberry Pi to capture an image of the user's paper. After applying unwarping and thresholding, the program uses Pytesseract (a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR) and Google Text to Speech to transform the image to text, and finally to audio. A speaker module attached to the Raspberry Pi then starts to read the text to the unsuspecting (and unconscious) user!<br><br>Additionally, anybody on the same network as the Raspberry Pi can connect to a webpage and view the status of the user (awake/asleep), his/her current heart rate, his/her average awake heart rate, and the text that he/she is reading. We hosted our Python server on the Raspberry Pi and set up a static IP and port (192.168.43.152:8000) on a mobile hotspot. However, the IP address is only accessible to users on the hotspot and while the program is running.</p>

  <h4>HW10: Chosen Idea</h4>

  <h4>Goal of Papercast</h4>
  <p>
    We will be moving forward with Papercast for our final project.
    Papercast solves the problem of alerting a reader when he/she is falling
    asleep, or in the very least, helping the reader to learn the content of
    the reading through passive learning via listening to the content. When
    a user is reading a paper or book and starts to drift off, Papercast turns
    the reading into a podcast and starts to play the reading into the user's
    earbuds or from the computer's speakers.
  </p>
  <h4>How Papercast fits into the project scope</h4>
  <p>
    We will need to lasercut some sort of eyewear that will hold the camera(s), as well as an enclosure that attaches the eyewear to an ear clip heart rate sensor. We will use a heart rate sensor that detects drops in the user's heart rate, indicating that the user is falling asleep. We will also use cameras to take a photo of the reading when the user is asleep. The data from the heart rate sensor and the photo from the cameras will be sent over wifi. We will process the heart rate data in real time, and if a drop in heart rate is detected, we will use the photo sent from the camera and transcribe the reading into speech. The user input for our project is the user's heart rate.
  </p>
  <h4>Final demo</h4>
  <p>
    For the final demo, we will demo the situation where a user is reading a
    paper and falls asleep. Papercast should be able to detect when the user
    falls asleep and should quickly start to play the reading aloud to the
    reader. Since it is difficult to live demo falling asleep, we would possibly
    hard code a decrease in heartrate based on previous measurements for the demo,
    or have other sensors such as a decrease in movement using an accelerometer.
